# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.

## Current Phase

- Phase 1 — Structure the data (the spine). Units 01–03 built; Unit 04 next.

## Current Goal

- Unit 04 — the case state machine over the schema Unit 03 laid down.

## Completed

- Six context files + `CLAUDE.md` entry point, aligned to the EvalOS Technical
  Design Document v1.1 (multi-brand, 8-stage, no object storage, no mail, manual
  payout ledger, roles GM/Brand-Mgr/PM/Coordinator/CM/ENM).
- `context/specs/00-build-plan.md` (20 units across 3 phases).
- **Unit 01 — Project scaffold & config.** Monorepo skeleton on the ground both
  halves stand on:
  - `backend/` re-based from the Initializr default (`com.evalos.server`, Boot
    4.1.0, Security + Lombok + Testcontainers) to the spec's `com.ie.evalos`,
    Spring Boot 3.5.16, Java 21. Deps: web, data-jpa, validation, actuator,
    flyway-core + flyway-database-postgresql, postgresql (runtime),
    spring-boot-starter-test. Empty package skeleton for the 12 boundaries.
  - `application.yml` + `local`/`prod` profiles, all env-backed
    (`DB_URL`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD`), `ddl-auto: validate`,
    `open-in-view: false`, Flyway on, actuator exposing `health` only.
    `spring.profiles.default: local`.
  - `V1__baseline.sql` — `pgcrypto` only, no domain tables.
  - `common/ApiResponse` envelope (`success`/`data`/`error`) + thin
    `web/HealthController` → `GET /api/health`.
  - `frontend/`: tokens from `ui-context.md` as CSS custom properties in
    `src/styles/tokens.css` (imported by `index.css`), fonts + radius scale via
    Tailwind v4 `@theme`, API client moved to `src/lib/api.ts` with the typed
    envelope, dashboard page renders backend health with a RAG dot.
  - Root `README.md` with run + verify steps.
  - Verified: `./mvnw clean verify` BUILD SUCCESS (1 test), `npm run build`
    clean.
- **Unit 02 — Multi-tenancy + Auth & RBAC/ABAC.** The guard rails everything
  scoped now depends on:
  - `Brand` + `TeamMember` entities and `V2`/`V3` migrations. `team_member`
    carries a CHECK that only a GM row may have a NULL `brand_id`, so a
    mis-seeded row cannot silently become cross-brand.
  - `Role` enum carries its own ABAC `Tier` (`ALL/BRAND/TEAM/SELF/SUPPLY`), so
    no query re-derives scope from the role name.
  - `security/`: stateless bearer-only `SecurityFilterChain`, BCrypt,
    `EvalOsUserDetailsService`, `JwtService` (HS256, claims carry
    member/role/brand/team so scoping needs no DB hit), `JwtFilter`,
    `StaffPrincipal`, `TenantContext` (read off the security context — brand
    never comes from a body, query, or header).
  - `ScopePredicate` — the one place brand/team/assignee predicates are built;
    **fails closed** (a brand-locked role with no brand matches nothing, not
    everything). `OwnershipGuard` is its write-side counterpart.
  - Endpoints: `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/me`,
    `GET /api/team-members` (`@PreAuthorize` GM/Brand-Manager, scoped in the
    service). `ApiErrors` writes the envelope for filter-chain 401/403s, which
    never reach `@RestControllerAdvice`.
  - Local-only seed `db/migration/local/V900__seed_local.sql` (2 brands,
    5 logins, password `DevPassw0rd!`), reachable only because the `local`
    profile is the only one listing that Flyway location.
  - Verified: `./mvnw clean verify` BUILD SUCCESS, 17 tests
    (`SecurityFlowTest` 10, `ScopePredicateTest` 6, `HealthControllerTest` 1),
    **plus a live run against local Postgres** — V1–V3 + V900 seed applied,
    `ddl-auto=validate` passed, and the acceptance flow verified end-to-end
    (GM all 5, Brand-Mgr IE only 3, Case-Mgr 403, no/garbage/flipped-sig token
    401, login-body `brandId` ignored). The DB half is no longer a gap.
- **Unit 03 — Domain model & migrations.** The system-of-record schema:
  - Entities + `V4`–`V10`: `ContactSnapshot`, `Case` (table `evalos_case`),
    `DocumentChecklistItem`, `Expert`, `PayoutLedger`, `Notification`,
    `AuditEvent` — every foreign key a raw UUID rather than an association, as in
    Unit 02, so scoping stays a plain column predicate.
  - The 21 vocabulary enums in `domain/`. `NotificationType` and `AuditAction`
    are open: their columns carry no CHECK, so later units add values without a
    migration.
  - `domain/ScopedEntity` (`@MappedSuperclass`) — the `id`/`brand_id`/`created_at`
    every scoped row shares, with a `@PrePersist` hook that stamps `created_at`
    and **refuses a row with no brand**. `brand_id` is `updatable = false`: a row
    never changes brand.
  - `common/PaymentDetailConverter` — AES-256-GCM, fresh 12-byte IV per write,
    stored as `base64(iv || ciphertext||tag)`, key from `EVALOS_FIELD_KEY` via
    `evalos.security.field-key` (no prod default, local dev default only). GCM is
    authenticated, so an edited column fails to decrypt rather than returning
    plausible plaintext. The cost is that the column is not searchable.
  - `repository/ScopedRepository` — `findScoped(ctx)` and `findScoped(ctx, id)`
    built on the Unit 02 `ScopePredicate`; each repository declares only which of
    its columns carry brand / team / assignee. `Case` is the one type using all
    three axes (`brandId`, `teamId`, `assignedCm`); `Notification` scopes by
    recipient; the rest are brand-only.
  - Append-only audit, enforced three times over: `AuditEventRepository` extends
    the bare `Repository` marker (so no `delete*` exists to call), every
    `AuditEvent` column is mapped `updatable = false`, and a
    `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger raises. `AuditService.recordEvent(...)`
    joins the caller's transaction, so the trail commits with the change it
    describes or not at all.
  - Verified: `./mvnw clean verify` BUILD SUCCESS, 37 tests (31 run —
    `SecurityFlowTest` 10, `DomainInvariantsTest` 9, `ScopePredicateTest` 6,
    `PaymentDetailConverterTest` 5, `HealthControllerTest` 1 — plus 6 DB-gated),
    **and live against local Postgres 18**: on a fresh `evalos_unit03` database
    all 11 migrations applied in order, the next boot was a no-op,
    `ddl-auto=validate` passed (so `text[]` and `jsonb` map correctly),
    `payment_detail` is base64 ciphertext in raw SQL and plaintext through the
    entity, a Brand Manager's `findScoped` returned only their brand's expert
    while the GM saw both, a brand-less row was refused before insert, and raw
    `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `audit_event` both raised. The dev `evalos` database was
    then migrated forward and re-verified.

## In Progress

- Nothing.

## Next Up

- Unit 04 — case state machine (calls `AuditService.recordEvent` on each
  transition, computes `sla_status`).

## Open Questions

- **Full brand list** — International Evaluations and XpertsPortal confirmed;
  confirm any others before seeding brands / webhook endpoints.
- **Sales/Marketing dashboards** — GHL-native (assumed; EvalOS does not build
  them) vs EvalOS-built. Default is GHL; confirm before Unit 17.
- **StatCommand** — internal module or external BI, and the "six operating
  conditions" the dashboards feed. Undefined; do not build a StatCommand
  integration until specified.
- **GHL webhook/API contract** — (a) per-brand inbound `payment.confirmed`
  payload + signing secret (Unit 05); (b) outbound subscriber URL + secret for
  `case.delivered` and the ability to send client-facing transactional messages
  on EvalOS event triggers (Unit 18); (c) which extra inbound GHL events to
  handle now vs later (`refund.requested`, `contact.updated`).
- **Dropbox Sign callback secret** — signing secret for signed/declined/viewed
  callbacks (Unit 15).
- **Staff SSO** — optional/later; JWT password login for v1.
- **FO-2026-CRM-01** — full credential-handling rules (disclaimer text captured
  per brand; remaining rules assumed satisfied by encryption + RBAC + audit).

## Architecture Decisions

- **Scope**: EvalOS is back-of-house only. GHL owns marketing, sales, invoicing,
  and review/retention delivery.
- **Multi-brand tenancy**: shared PostgreSQL, row-level tenancy by `brand_id`,
  brand + team + assignee scoping enforced at the query layer. GM is the only
  cross-brand role. Brand resolved at Handoff A by per-brand webhook endpoint
  (each brand is a separate GHL sub-account).
- **Stack**: Java 21 + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL (Spring Data JPA), Flyway, Spring
  Security + JWT; React + Vite + Tailwind; monorepo, base package `com.ie.evalos`.
  (Overrides the original Node/Express/MongoDB reuse idea.)
- **Roles**: GM, Brand Manager, Project Manager, Project Coordinator, Case
  Manager, Expert Network Manager. No Head-of-Evals, no interns. Sales/marketing
  roles stay in GHL. Client and expert portals are separate scoped, link-based
  auth surfaces.
- **Pipeline**: 8-stage canonical model; EvalOS owns stages 3–7 via the internal
  state machine `DOC_COLLECTION → EXPERT_ASSIGNMENT → DRAFT_GENERATION →
  EXPERT_SIGNING → FINAL_DELIVERY → CLOSED` + exception states. Draft/PM/client
  loops live inside `DRAFT_GENERATION`. Pool → PM → CM assignment.
- **Refund**: GM-only approval; reverses revenue recognition, voids the pending
  payout, signals GHL.
- **No object storage**: documents are Google Drive links; signed letters in
  Dropbox Sign; redacted CV generated on demand.
- **No mail server**: staff in-app notification center; client messages via GHL;
  expert notifications via Dropbox Sign (portal-only nudges).
- **Payouts**: manual ledger form, no payment-platform/disbursement rail. Single
  optional encrypted `payment_detail` field.
- **Handoff A**: GHL fires the per-brand "payment confirmed" webhook (the webhook
  is the proof); EvalOS creates the case idempotently. No direct payment-processor
  integration.
- **E-signature**: Dropbox Sign.
- **Contacts**: GHL is the owner; EvalOS keeps a read-only, brand-tagged snapshot.
- **NFR**: 50–100 cases/brand/month; ~99% availability, single region; nightly
  backups; SLA calendar America/Los_Angeles (9–5 PT, US federal holidays); UTC
  storage. GDPR/CCPA-specific handling out of scope for v1.

## Session Notes

- **Unit 01 deviations / gaps to close.** (a) The spec's `./mvnw verify` covers
  compile + the health-endpoint test only — a full context-load test needs a
  Postgres, and this machine has neither Docker nor a local Postgres, so
  "app starts, Flyway applies V1 once" is **unverified**; add a Testcontainers
  `@SpringBootTest` in Unit 03 when entities make it worth it. (b) Inter /
  IBM Plex Mono are declared as font stacks with system fallbacks; the actual
  webfonts are not bundled. (c) Boot 3.5.16 chosen over the Initializr's 4.1.0
  to match the spec's "Spring Boot 3.x". (d) Stale `backend/target/` from the
  old scaffold breaks surefire discovery — run `./mvnw clean verify` once.

- **Unit 02 deviations / gaps to close.** (a) ~~DB half unverified~~ —
  **closed**: verified live against local Postgres (postgres/1234, db `evalos`
  created this session). Unit 03 should still add a Testcontainers
  `@SpringBootTest` so the DB path is covered in CI, not just by a manual local
  run (and to re-add the testcontainers deps dropped when the scaffold was
  re-based). (b) `/api/me`
  lives in `AuthController`, not the spec's separate `MeController` — same
  concern (staff identity), one fewer file. (c) `@WebMvcTest` slices must
  `@Import` the security stack and set `evalos.security.jwt.secret`, because
  `JwtFilter` is picked up as a `Filter` bean while `JwtService` is not — that
  is what broke Unit 01's `HealthControllerTest`; it now imports the real
  `SecurityConfig` and so also asserts health stays public. (d) The IDE flags
  `evalos.*` as an unknown property — expected, those values are read with
  `@Value`, not `@ConfigurationProperties`. (e) The JWT carries role/brand/team,
  so a role or brand change only takes effect on the next login; the 8h TTL
  bounds it. Revisit if instant revocation is ever required.

- **Unit 03 deviations / gaps to close.**
  (a) **Flyway out-of-order, local only.** The `V900` local seed sits above every
  real migration, so on a dev database that had already run it, `V4`–`V10` looked
  out of order and Flyway refused them — a latent Unit 02 defect that Unit 03's
  first new migration surfaced. Fixed with `spring.flyway.out-of-order: true` in
  the `local` profile, the only profile that applies the seed; `prod` keeps the
  strict default. Fresh databases were never affected.
  (b) **Accessors are added when a consumer appears.** Entities carry their mapped
  fields, a creation constructor for the required columns, and nothing else;
  Hibernate uses field access, so getters are not needed to persist or validate.
  `ScopedEntity` exposes `id`/`brandId`/`createdAt`, `Expert` exposes
  `payment_detail`, and `AuditEvent` has full getters because its finders return
  rows to be read. Unit 04 adds the stage/SLA accessors the state machine needs
  rather than 400 lines of speculative boilerplate now.
  (c) **`created_at` added to three tables** the spec's per-table lists omitted
  (`contact_snapshot`, `document_checklist_item`, `expert`) — the spec's blanket
  "every table has `brand_id` and timestamps" plus deliverable 6's `created_at`
  stamp both call for it.
  (d) **Columns with a spec default are NOT NULL** (`draft_version_count`,
  `google_review_requested`, `total_cases_completed`, `current_active_count`,
  `total_payments_pending`) because the Java fields are primitives / never null.
  (e) **`evalos_case.expert_id`'s foreign key is added in `V7`**, not `V5`: the
  `expert` table does not exist yet at `V5`. The column and its
  `(brand_id, expert_id)` index are in `V5` as specified.
  (f) **Audit brand is derived, not passed.** `recordEvent(...)` has no `brandId`
  parameter, so the brand comes from `TenantContext` — never from an argument a
  caller could get wrong. A system action outside a request records a null brand,
  which the nullable column allows; so does a GM action, since a GM has no brand.
  (g) **`object_type` stays a `String`**, matching the spec's signature. No
  `AuditObjectType` enum is defined anywhere in the design; add one if Unit 04
  finds the loose strings drifting.
  (h) **`text[]` columns map as `String[]`**, not enum arrays — `PerformanceFlag`
  is the vocabulary, applied at the service layer. Enum-array mapping buys
  nothing here and risks `ddl-auto=validate` mismatches.
  (i) **No CHECK constraints on the enum columns.** The spec does not ask for
  them; `V3`'s `role` CHECK was Unit 02's own call. Cheap to add later if a
  hand-written row ever needs guarding.
  (j) `ScopePredicate` still lives in `service` (Unit 02 put it there) and
  `repository` now imports it — inverted layering, but it is a static helper with
  no dependencies, so there is no cycle and moving it would touch Unit 02 code for
  no behavioural gain.
  (k) **Contact snapshot columns stay updatable.** Invariant 7 means EvalOS
  business rules never mutate them, not that the column is physically read-only —
  `architecture.md` has GHL's `contact.updated` refreshing the snapshot, and
  `updatable = false` would block that writer too. The rule is documented on the
  entity instead.
  (l) **Testcontainers gap still open.** The DB checks live in
  `LocalPostgresIntegrationTest`, gated on `-Devalos.db.test=true`, because this
  machine has no Docker; `./mvnw verify` therefore stays green anywhere and skips
  those 6. Convert it to Testcontainers when CI (or Docker) exists — the test
  bodies will not need to change, only how the database is provided.
  (m) Fixed in passing: `README.md` said a Brand Manager sees "four" seeded team
  members; the seed gives them three.

- **Unit 03 review pass — three data-contract ambiguities closed** (all verified
  by `verify` + the DB suite; no schema change, so no new migration):
  (a) **One clock for every timestamp.** `AuditEvent.created_at` was
  database-stamped (`insertable = false`) while every `ScopedEntity` stamps in
  `@PrePersist`. Two clocks in one schema means a timeline interleaving a row's
  `created_at` with its audit rows can order wrongly once app and DB sit on
  different hosts. Audit now stamps in Java like everything else; the column keeps
  `DEFAULT now()` as the raw-SQL backstop.
  (b) **No column name is derived.** Roughly 20 single-word columns (plus both
  `id`s) relied on `CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy` to guess their name.
  Every column is now spelled out with `@Column(name = ...)`, matching Unit 02's
  `TeamMember`. This is deliberately *more* code: the column name is a contract
  shared with the migrations, and the strategy does not always agree with it —
  `retention30SentAt` derives to `retention30_sent_at`, not the real
  `retention_30_sent_at`.
  (c) **The scope axis can no longer be forgotten.** `scopeFields()` stays
  abstract (a brand-only default would fail *open*), and `DomainInvariantsTest`
  now also asserts that an entity declaring `teamId` scopes by it, and that every
  `ScopedEntity` subclass on the classpath appears in the repository scope table —
  so adding an entity without declaring its scope breaks the build.
  Also cut in the same pass: 44 lines of accessors and creation constructors with
  no caller (4 entity constructors, `Notification.isRead`/`markRead`,
  `AuditEvent.getObjectType`/`getObjectId`).

- **Unit 02 latent test bug, surfaced and fixed.**
  `SecurityFlowTest.tamperedTokenIsUnauthenticated` flipped the **last** character
  of the JWT signature. base64url of a 32-byte HMAC is 43 characters, so the final
  one carries only four meaningful bits — flipping it can decode to the same
  signature, and the tampered token then verifies (the test returned 200, not 401).
  It had been passing on the luck of what the signature ended with. It now flips
  the first, fully significant, signature character.

- Reconciled from three source documents (`IE_CRM_Spec_v2`, the Hybrid Platform
  Architecture, and the Feature Inventory FRD) into the EvalOS Technical Design
  Document v1.1, which is the source of truth. Where the original context files
  conflicted with v1.1, v1.1 wins (multi-brand, 8-stage, no object storage, no
  mail, manual payouts, GM/Brand-Manager roles).
- CRM spec automation rules A05–A24 (production/expert/delivery/KPI) are in scope
  across Units 04–19; A01–A04/A06 (lead/sales/marketing) are GHL's job.
